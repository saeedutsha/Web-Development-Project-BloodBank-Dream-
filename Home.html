	<div class="content1"> <img src="images/c1.jpg"> <p class="display">Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.</p> </div>
	<div class="content2"> <img src="images/c2.jpg"> <p class="display">"EVERY BLOOD DONOR IS A HERO" focuses on the idea that every one of us can become a hero by giving blood. The everyday hero responds to an immediate need, whatever the conditions, despite inconvenience, putting the needs of others above their own. Voluntary blood donors come from all walks of life, all regions, backgrounds, religions and ages. By choosing to donate blood without getting paid, these individuals commit a "heroic" act, a gesture of human solidarity with the power to save lives. Some of them do so dozens of times over several decades. </p> </div>
	<div class="content3"> <img src="images/c3.jpg"><p class="display">One blood donation can save 3 to 4 lives. Donating blood is safe, quick, and easy, but fear of needles, feeling weak, or believing others are donating enough keep people away. Please don’t stay away! We dug up some information to get you more comfortable with the blood donation process. Typically, two or three of these are produced from a pint of donated whole blood. A single donation can potentially help more than one patient. The process of donating specificblood components – red cells, plasma or platelets – is called apheresis.</p> </div>
