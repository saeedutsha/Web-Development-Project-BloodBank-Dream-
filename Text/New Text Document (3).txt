Dream is the Voluntary Blood Donation Organization of KUET. In order to ensure that a person's life is not endangered in the absence of a drop of blood, Dream began his career in 2005. Dream is the main task of providing patient's blood from students of Khulna University of Engineering and Technology. Besides, every year, in the Orientation program, students of Blood Spinning Campaign, Khulna and Khulna are working outside the campaign to donate through Dream.
Blood donation system: Dream has no own blood bank. Regarding the patient's requirements, we collect blood from our medical center by contacting our blood donor on our campus. To take blood from us, you must have the following documents:1 Photocopy of the patient's patient's Blood Requisition Form
2. Patient's blood samples
3 photocopies of national identification card of collector
